== State of the art

Many protocols are used today to communicate between different services over different types of networks. Here are some of them:

* Http
* GRPC
* Brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)

These protocols can be implmented in different ways, and they have different advantages and disadvantages. Async communication, sync communication, and event-driven communication.

When a event is sent a central serviec must dispatch events.

The communication with the client will be done with HTTP and Websockets.
and the communication between the services will be done with GRPC.
