== Service mesh

Main concepts:
A proxy is a sidecar container that intercepts all incoming and outgoing traffic to the service.

It allows to add features like:
- Load balancing
- Service discovery
- Circuit breaking
- Rate limiting
- Observability

Always have a health check
Added retry logic
Big advantage is that we don't need to implement network logic in the application
Easily do canary deployments (90 of traffic on the new version of the application and 10 on the old one)

With istio the new service added to the clutser is automatically added to the service mesh
mTls is a must have in a service mesh
itio implements gateway
