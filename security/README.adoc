== Service mesh

Main concepts:
A proxy is a sidecar container that intercepts all incoming and outgoing traffic to the service.

It allows to add features like:
- Load balancing
- Service discovery
- Circuit breaking
- Rate limiting
- Observability

Always have a health check
Added retry logic
Big advantage is that we don't need to implement network logic in the application
Easily do canary deployments (90 of traffic on the new version of the application and 10 on the old one)

With istio the new service added to the clutser is automatically added to the service mesh
mTls is a must have in a service mesh
itio implements gateway



== How do I manage the authentication system with an OIDC?

There are severals authentication protocols like:
- OAuth2
- OIDC
- SAML
- LDAP
- Kerberos 

These are normally used to authenticate users in a system. We will try to choose wisely in order. To help us with that we will try to enumerate the requirements of the system.
As any system needs

== Implications of Authentication in a Microservices Application

Authentication in a microservices application has several implications:

1. **Decentralized Authentication**: Each microservice may need to handle authentication independently, which can lead to inconsistencies and increased complexity. A centralized authentication service or gateway can help manage this.

2. **Token Management**: Microservices often rely on tokens (e.g., JWT) for authentication. Proper token management, including issuance, validation, and expiration, is crucial to ensure security.

3. **Inter-Service Communication**: When microservices communicate with each other, they need to authenticate requests. This can be achieved using mutual TLS (mTLS) or token-based authentication.

4. **Scalability**: Authentication mechanisms must be scalable to handle a large number of requests. This includes efficient token validation and minimizing the performance impact on microservices.

5. **Security**: Ensuring secure transmission of authentication credentials and tokens is essential. This includes using HTTPS, secure storage of secrets, and regular security audits.

6. **User Experience**: A seamless authentication experience is important for users. Single Sign-On (SSO) can help provide a unified authentication experience across multiple microservices.

7. **Compliance**: Adhering to regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) for authentication and user data management is critical in many industries.

By carefully considering these implications, you can design a robust and secure authentication system for your microservices application.


=== Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user is allowed to perform within a system. It involves enforcing access control policies based on the user's identity, roles, and permissions. 

In the case of beep we will need to authorize the user at different levels and therefore we will need fine grained authorization.
A user can endorse different global roles such as:

- ApplicationAdministrator
- UserAdministrator
- ServerAdministrator

Also, with the right permission users will be able to create role in a server.
Those role will be linked to permissions to perform different actions on the resouces of the server (ex: Members, Channels ...).

This service will be called each time a user wants to perform an on a resource across the application. We need a reliable service that will allow to be called from any service in the application.

Different project could be useful and could implements different authorization policies.

Few technologies can help us to implement the authorization service:

- OPA
- Keycloak
- Permify
- Casbin

== Keycloak
Keycloak provide a complex authorization system that can be used to manage the authorization of the user in the application. For exemple we can define a role that can perform any action on any subject (channels, webhooks, etc.) in the application.

== OPA
OPA is a general-purpose policy engine that can be used to enforce fine-grained authorization policies in microservices applications. 
It can be integrated with Istio to enforce access control based on attributes of the request.

== Permify
Permify is a permission management system that can be used to define and enforce access control policies in microservices applications.
It provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing permissions and roles.

You can define entities, relation and schema to manage the permissions of the user in the application.
You can interact with the api using Grpc or Rest with Go or NodeJs.

Drawbacks:
- Having to maintain the schema of the entities
- Having to maintain the relation between the entities


== Casbin
Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library for Golang projects. It supports various access control models, including RBAC, ABAC, and PBAC, and can be easily integrated into microservices applications.
