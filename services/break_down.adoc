=== Servers Features

A server is an aggregation of channels, roles, and users that will be called members in that context.

Channels are used to separate conversations in a server. They can be text or voice channels.

Roles are used to manage permissions in a server. They can be assigned to a members.

Members can have different roles in a server. Their is a role by default called "BasicMember", and they can also be created.

Serveral permissions can be granted to roles:

* `ADMINISTRATOR`: Can perform any action on any subject (channels, webhooks, etc.) in a server.
* `MANAGE_SERVER`: Can update a server (all CRUD operations except delete).
* `MANAGE_ROLES`: Can perform all CRUD operations on all roles.
* `CREATE_INVITATION`: Can create server invites.
* `MANAGE_CHANNELS`: Can perform all CRUD operations on every channel.
* `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS`: Can perform all CRUD operations on every webhook.
* `VIEW_CHANNELS`: Can see the channel and its contents (messages).
* `SEND_MESSAGES`: Can send messages on the channel.
* `MANAGE_NICKNAMES`: Can update other users’ nicknames.
* `CHANGE_NICKNAME`: Can update your own nickname.
* `MANAGE_MESSAGES`: Can delete other users’ messages.

A role can have multiple permissions. A member can have multiple roles in the same server.

=== Global Roles

A role is not necesseraliy linked to a server. It can be a global role. I would allow to have administator role that can perform any action on any subject (channels, webhooks, etc.) in the application. 

Roles would be:

- ApplicationAdministrator
- UserAdministrator
- ServerAdministrator

ApplicationAdministrator can perform any action on any subject (channels, webhooks, etc.) in the application. It implies that he will be inherit from all the abilities of the other roles.

== Neighborhood

As we saw some functionalities are related to each other. We can regroup them in functional parts. We will increment the application by adding these functionalities one by one from the less dependant to the most dependant.
We can extract from the use cases some entities that will be used in the application.

First of all, any person that want to access the application needs to be registered. We will need to have its profile information and the global permission. By default he has no role assigned.
This service should be reachable from anywhere in the application in order to acknowledge the user's permission.

=== Authorization

We will need to enforce the authorization of the user. We will need to have a service that will check if the user has the permission to perform an action. This service will be used in the whole application.

=== Communication

The communication will regroup anything that allow users to communicate with each other. 
Basically any message or vocal communication will be linked to a channel of the application.
Those channel can be assigned to server but in the case of private conversation users will have their own channel.

A service will be dedicated to messages. In order to validate 


=== Server

As we saw in the use cases, a server will regroup users and channels. The role associated to permission will allow manage the server entities.
